# Drive Motors for Wheels

Code and project for controlling drive motors turning wheels.

Using [SparkFun Motor Driver - Dual TB6612FNG](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14450) with a Raspberry Pi Pico RP2040 & MicroPython.

Hardware hookup guide is at https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/tb6612fng-hookup-guide

Since we're using a Raspberry Pi Pico instead of Arduino, [Sparkfun's Arduino driver](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_TB6612FNG_Arduino_Library) won't work and wrote one at `/tb6612fng`.
