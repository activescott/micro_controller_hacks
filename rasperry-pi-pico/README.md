# Raspberry Pi Pico with RP2040

My adventures with MicroPython on Raspberry Pi Pico with RP2040.

## Hardware:
- [Raspberry Pi's docs for the Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/) are great.
- Pinout: https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/images/Pico-R3-SDK11-Pinout.svg

## MicroPython
- Using [MicroPython](https://micropython.org/)
- [MicroPython Libraries Reference](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/library/index.html)
- [https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-micropython-examples](Raspberry Pi's provided examples w/ MicroPython)

### [Thonny IDE](https://thonny.org/)

- Primary reason for using this is because it makes nice REPL and uploading code to MicroPython devices super fast. The alternative is [The pyboard.py tool](http://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/reference/pyboard.py.html).
- Be sure to Select **Files** from the **View** main menu!

Misc:
- Tensorflow Light: https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/accessories/camera.html#post-processing-with-tensorflow-lite
