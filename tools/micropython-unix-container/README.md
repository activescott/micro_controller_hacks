# micropython-unix-container
A container for MicroPython unix port.
There were a few of these on dockerhub but I couldn't get even basic stuff like upip to work on any of them (including the micropython provided container).

It worked, but I later found I didn't really use it so much after I got it working.

I wanted to use it to install packages on a device but just kept using thonny instead since it is so easy and upip on unix port doesn't do anything special.
For optimizing packages on device this could be useful. May also useful for testing.
